## Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do I need to provide a credit card and phone number for a Free Google Cloud Account?**

*[From Google Cloud FAQ]: You're always required to provide a credit card or a bank account in order to verify that you're not a bot. You won't be charged until you upgrade to a paid account. Google has limits on all of their free tiers to prevent users from going over thresholds.*

**Do I need to use the same email address for my GitHub and Google Cloud Accounts?**

*No, your GitHub and Google Cloud accounts can use different email addresses.*

**Can I use my work email address to sign up for a Free Google Cloud Account?**

*We recommend using a personal email address when signing up for a Free Google Cloud Account.*

**Can I use an exising Google Cloud account I have access to?**

*Yes, however you must have Owner rights in the Google Cloud project you are working on. If you are not sure if you have the required permissions we recommend creating a Free Google Cloud Account where you will have these permissions.*
